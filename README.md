What it can do now:
Currently you can allocate and dealocate memory
Does not reorder memory yet

Todo:
Limit searches so that it only looks within the offset and not the entire registry
Remove redundant null checks for reusing Sections since it works diferently than I tought
Reorder memory logic
Remove any mmalloc calls
Make it safer to use and avoid memory issues
